At the heart of this are the data resources, tools and services that ELIXIR offers to the life-sciences community, providing stable and sustainable access to biological data. ELIXIR aims to ensure that these resources are available long-term and that the life-cycles of these resources are managed such that they support the scientific needs of the life-sciences, including biological research. ELIXIR Core Data Resources are defined as a set of European data resources that are of fundamental importance to the wider life-science community and the long-term preservation of biological data. They are complete collections of generic value to life-science, are considered an authority in their field with respect to one or more characteristics, and show high levels of scientific quality and service. Thus, ELIXIR Core Data Resources are of wide applicability and usage. This paper describes the structures, governance and processes that support the identification and evaluation of ELIXIR Core Data Resources. It identifies key indicators which reflect the essence of the definition of an ELIXIR Core Data Resource and support the promotion of excellence in resource development and operation. It describes the specific indicators in more detail and explains their application within ELIXIR's sustainability strategy and science policy actions, and in capacity building, life-cycle management and technical actions. The identification process is currently being implemented and tested for the first time. The findings and outcome will be evaluated by the ELIXIR Scientific Advisory Board in March 2017.

Parasitoids exploit these VOCs as odor cues to locate their hosts. In nature, host-related odors are emitted as blends of various compounds occurring in different proportions, and minor blend components can sometimes have profound effects on parasitoid responses. In a previous related study, we identified and quantified VOCs emitted by cotton plant-fed (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae, an herbivore host of the parasitoid  (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). In the present study, the olfactory response of female .  to synthetic versions of 15 previously identified compounds was tested in electroantennogram (EAG) bioassays. Using  as a model species, we further asked the question: does the relative abundance of a volatile compound match the level of antennal response in parasitoids? Female  showed varying EAG responses to test compounds, indicating different levels of bioactivity in the insect antenna. Eight compounds, including decanal, 1-octen-3-ol, 3-octanone, 2-ethylhexanol, tridecane, tetradecane, α-farnesene and bisabolene, elicited EAG responses above or equal to the 50  percentile rank of all responses. Interestingly, decanal, which represented only 1% of the total amount of odors emitted by cotton-fed hosts, elicited the highest (0.82 mV) EAG response in parasitoids. On the other hand, ( )-β-caryophyllene, the most abundant (29%) blend component, elicited a relatively low (0.17 mV) EAG response. The results suggest that EAG response to host-related volatiles in parasitoids is probably more influenced by the ecological relevance or functional role of the compound in the blend, rather than its relative abundance.                                                                                                                                                                                            |herbivores emit volatile organic compounds (vocs) after feeding on plants. parasitoids exploit these vocs as odor cues to locate their hosts. in nature, host-related odors are emitted as blends of various compounds occurring in different proportions, and minor blend components can sometimes have profound effects on parasitoid responses. in a previous related study, we identified and quantified vocs emitted by cotton plant-fed (lepidoptera: noctuidae) larvae, an herbivore host of the parasitoid  (hymenoptera: braconidae). in the present study, the olfactory response of female .  to synthetic versions of 15 previously identified compounds was tested in electroantennogram (eag) bioassays. using  as a model species, we further asked the question: does the relative abundance of a volatile compound match the level of antennal response in parasitoids? female  showed varying eag responses to test compounds, indicating different levels of bioactivity in the insect antenna. eight compounds, including decanal, 1-octen-3-ol, 3-octanone, 2-ethylhexanol, tridecane, tetradecane, α-farnesene and bisabolene, elicited eag responses above or equal to the 50  percentile rank of all responses. interestingly, decanal, which represented only 1% of the total amount of odors emitted by cotton-fed hosts, elicited the highest (0.82 mv) eag response in parasitoids. on the other hand, ( )-β-caryophyllene, the most abundant (29%) blend component, elicited a relatively low (0.17 mv) eag response. the results suggest that eag response to host-related volatiles in parasitoids is probably more influenced by the ecological relevance or functional role of the compound in the blend, rather than its relative abundance.                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",
